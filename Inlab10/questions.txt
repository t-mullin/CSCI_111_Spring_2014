1. Since there is no instance of the Recursion class 
being made, the methods do not need to be accessed by 
an instance of the class.

2. Most of the methods are static becuase in the Math class
all of the methods are also static. Yes, but that would involve 
global variables and other methods to some of the work. The way
the code is set up is the best for this application.
