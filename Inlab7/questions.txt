1. The function doen't have to do alot of calculations for X^2 because it only uses one varible, 
   x then times by x to find the height. 
 
2. As the number of rectangles increases the width of each rectangle gets closer
   and closer to 1, so at a point the base becomes negligible and heights 
   are being added to the total area.
 
3. The numericallyIntegrate takes in the paramaters, 
   while the constructor is set to the default no arguement constructor.

4. Since the driver doesn't call the default constructor; the static keyword allows
   numericallyIntegrate to be executed without an instance of the 
   Intergration class being created.
